All the lonely people: 
Towards automated scalable monitoring of responses to people at risk on Social Media

Following is the abstract:
We are in the midst of a new era of ubiquitous social media. The way people talk is changing, as is the definition of a friend, and who belongs to our social group that now includes and may even encompass people we are connected to through social media. A growing number of people are using social media on a daily basis. It has become a venue for people to express their feelings and thoughts, even when lonely and seeking support. However, it is unclear how much of this support is received and whether it is effective. Much research has been done on automating the ability to identify lonely people. However, there are no automated tools to identify whether a person is receiving a response from its peers or not, and is it helping him or not. Concurrently, the maturation of Machine Learning technologies offers the opportunity to automate and thus scale the capability of mental health and counseling professionals to monitor and intervene. The proposed project aims to provide the automated capability to identify cases where lonely people expressing their loneliness on social media are not receiving support from their peers. To do so, we will explore various definitions for emotional support and their manifestations in social media, as well as machine learning-based methods to identify and quantify these behaviors
